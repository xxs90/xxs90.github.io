I am a M.S. Robotics student at Northeastern University. Before, I was in Virginia Tech majored in Controls, Robotics, and Autonomy and minor in Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics.

I am really passion in topic of robotics, like manipulation, planning, perception and etc. My currect research topic is in reinforcement learning and manipulation. And I have more than three years experience in robotics design in mechanical and embedded programming.

Wish to become a robot engineer in the biomedical field!
