I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I work in [Robotics:Perception and Manipulation (RPM) Lab](https://rpm-lab.github.io/) with Professor [Karthik Desingh](https://karthikdesingh.com/). I am passionate about robotics, like vision, manipulation, planning, and perception. My current research topic is robot learning and manipulation with equivariant symmetric.

Before that, I worked as a research assistant in [The Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/) advised by Professor [Robert Platt](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/robert-platt/). Prior to my Ph.D. study, I received my Master's degree in Robotics from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) and my Bacholor's degree in Computer Engineering (Controls, Robotics, and Autonomy) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/) and minored in Mathematics and Biomedical Engineering.  

I have more than three years experience in robotics mechanical design, embedded programming and software development. Willing to be a robotic scientist!
