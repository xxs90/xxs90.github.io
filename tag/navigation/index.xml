These sensors are non-integrated, decentralized, and in most cases need to be configured separately. Researchers need to spend a great amount of time on the installation and configuration of these sensors. Meanwhile, the iPhone is a highly integrated electronic device with multiple precise sensors, but few researchers have used the iPhone as a hardware device for algorithm development because of the closed source properties of IOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To this end, we aim to develop an IOS-based ORBSLAM algorithm that has demonstrated the exploitability of the iPhone as well as providing a new possibilities of research platform. On another point, The advanced perception sensor on the iphone gives some imagination to the future development of the IOS-based metaverse app. By using the iPhone, many interesting applications can be further extended, such as augmented reality, indoor localization, etc.&lt;/p>
