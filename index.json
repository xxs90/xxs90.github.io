Ideally, the system would adapt to the real world by training directly on physical systems. However, this is generally difficult due to the large amount of training data required by most grasp learning models. In this paper, we note that the planar grasp function is SE(2)-equivariant and demonstrate that this structure can be used to constrain the neural network used during learning. This creates an inductive bias that can significantly improve the sample efficiency of grasp learning and enable end-to-end training from scratch on a physical robot with as few as 600 grasp attempts. We call this method Symmetric Grasp learning (SymGrasp) and show that it can learn to grasp “from scratch” in less that 1.5 h of physical robot time.

Traditional image-level data augmentation has shown the potential to improve sample efficiency in various machine learning tasks. However, image-level data augmentation is insufficient for an imitation learning agent to learn good manipulation policies in a reasonable amount of demonstrations. We propose Simulation-augmented Equivariant Imitation Learning (SEIL), a method that combines a novel data augmentation strategy of supplementing expert trajectories with simulated transitions and an equivariant model that exploits the $O(2)$ symmetry in robotic manipulation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method can learn non-trivial manipulation tasks within ten demonstrations and outperforms the baselines with a significant margin. **Project page with more details at https://saulbatman.github.io/project/seil/.**","tags":["manipulation","learning"],"title":"SEIL: Simulation-augmented Equivariant Imitation Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"c29dd5e8a3c21609aaf6a12f318f8333","permalink":"https://xxs90.github.io/talk/self-introduction/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/self-introduction/","section":"event","summary":"An introduction video of me.","tags":null,"title":"Self Introduction","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction For navigation in robotics fields, especially autonomous driving tasks, accurate estimation of motion and 3D dynamic scene understanding are important for perception.

Therefore, a segmentation error would lead to incorrect estimation in the future motion prediction for each object. Rather than directly applying to the data, scene flow estimation could compute a 3D motion vector for each point in the scene and remove reliance on the object.\nThis project proposed using point cloud data rather than directly estimating the 3D motion field from RGB images, followed by recent research.\n","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664582400,"objectID":"17e9d8e4c95753b06f789f006c5a364b","permalink":"https://xxs90.github.io/project/sceneflow/","publishdate":"2022-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sceneflow/","section":"project","summary":"An End-to-end scene flow estimation with PyTorch.","tags":["vision","learning"],"title":"Scene Flow Estimation for Autonomous Driving","type":"project"},{"authors":["Xupeng Zhu","Dian Wang","Ondrej Biza","Guanang Su","Robin Walters","Robert Platt"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":165888e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":165888e4,"objectID":"ca2f35ded4fc48146867c293d3aa8ed2","permalink":"https://xxs90.github.io/publication/rss_2022/","publishdate":"2022-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rss_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"In planar grasp detection, the goal is to learn a function from an image of a scene onto a set of feasible grasp poses in SE(2).
