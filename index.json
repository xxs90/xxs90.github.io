Scene flow, a joint prediction method that comes up with the optical flow and stereo matching could faster solve the task and improves generalization by leveraging domain-specific information and avoiding bias.\nFor a traditional motion tracking pipeline, inputs the 3D data to do an object detection segmentation with segmenting into unique objects and then apply for the object tracking individually. Therefore, a segmentation error would lead to incorrect estimation in the future motion prediction for each object. Rather than directly applying to the data, scene flow estimation could compute a 3D motion vector for each point in the scene and remove reliance on the object.\nThis project proposed using point cloud data rather than directly estimating the 3D motion field from RGB images, followed by recent research.\n","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664582400,"objectID":"17e9d8e4c95753b06f789f006c5a364b","permalink":"https://xxs90.github.io/project/sceneflow/","publishdate":"2022-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sceneflow/","section":"project","summary":"An End-to-end scene flow estimation with PyTorch.","tags":["vision","learning"],"title":"Scene Flow Estimation for Autonomous Driving","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mingxi Jia","Dian Wang","Guanang Su","David Klee","Xupeng Zhu","Robin Walters","Robert Platt"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"0ef432fe9fef105a39f66d97811f69b8","permalink":"https://xxs90.github.io/publication/icra_2023/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icra_2023/","section":"publication","summary":"In robotic manipulation, acquiring samples is extremely expensive because it often requires interacting with the real world. Traditional image-level data augmentation has shown the potential to improve sample efficiency in various machine learning tasks. However, image-level data augmentation is insufficient for an imitation learning agent to learn good manipulation policies in a reasonable amount of demonstrations. We propose Simulation-augmented Equivariant Imitation Learning (SEIL), a method that combines a novel data augmentation strategy of supplementing expert trajectories with simulated transitions and an equivariant model that exploits the $O(2)$ symmetry in robotic manipulation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method can learn non-trivial manipulation tasks within ten demonstrations and outperforms the baselines with a significant margin. **Project page with more details at https://saulbatman.github.io/project/seil/.**","tags":["manipulation","learning"],"title":"SEIL: Simulation-augmented Equivariant Imitation Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xupeng Zhu","Dian Wang","Ondrej Biza","Guanang Su","Robin Walters","Robert Platt"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":165888e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":165888e4,"objectID":"ca2f35ded4fc48146867c293d3aa8ed2","permalink":"https://xxs90.github.io/publication/rss_2022/","publishdate":"2022-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rss_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"In planar grasp detection, the goal is to learn a function from an image of a scene onto a set of feasible grasp poses in SE(2). In this paper, we recognize that the optimal grasp function is SE(2)-equivariant and can be modeled using an equivariant convolutional neural network. As a result, we are able to significantly improve the sample efficiency of grasp learning, obtaining a good approximation of the grasp function after only 600 grasp attempts. This is few enough that we can learn to grasp completely on a physical robot in about 1.5 hours. **Project page with more details at https://zxp-s-works.github.io/equivariant_grasp_site/.**","tags":["manipulation","learning"],"title":"Sample Efficient Grasp Learning Using Equivariant Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
